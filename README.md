Gestational Diabetes Prediction System
🔍 Machine Learning-based Classification and Prediction for Early Screening of Gestational Diabetes

📌 Project Overview
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who did not have diabetes before. It significantly increases the mother’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life and can lead to complications such as larger babies, early delivery, and neonatal health issues.

This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to accurately predict gestational diabetes in its early stages using patient data. The dataset used is the PIMA Diabetes dataset from Kaggle, and the model is trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression to improve prediction accuracy.
